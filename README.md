# XML-TO-EXCEL
This code reads a folder with xml files in it, read each file searching for the tags specified and writes an excel sheet with headers and cells with the specified tags.

If you want to change the tags the code will search for first change the data and __data to what you want(this will be the header of the excel collumn). After that you need to change within the for loop the value of each if ele.tag for the tag you want.

There's a little interface for you to use in case you want.
